			<p>Video upscaling, the process of increasing the resolution of a video, has been a popular technique for enhancing the viewing experience of older content. However, traditional upscaling techniques often result in blurry or pixelated images that lack the sharpness and detail of true high-resolution video.</p>
<p>Fortunately, advances neural networks have led to the development of more sophisticated upscaling algorithms that can produce remarkably detailed and clear images. These algorithms use machine learning models to analyze and reconstruct low-resolution video frames, filling in missing information and enhancing fine details.</p>
<p>One of the most promising approaches to video upscaling using AI is known as super-resolution. Super-resolution algorithms leverage deep neural networks to learn complex mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution video frames, allowing them to generate images that are both sharper and more detailed than those produced by traditional upscaling methods.</p>
<p>Another key advantage of AI-based upscaling is its ability to adapt to different types of content. Machine learning models can be trained on specific types of videos, such as movies or television shows, to learn the specific characteristics of those types of content and produce higher-quality results.</p>
<p>Overall, the use of AI in video upscaling holds great promise for improving the quality of older video content and enhancing the viewing experience for audiences. As machine learning models continue to improve and become more sophisticated, we can expect even more impressive results in the future.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example, I took some old footage of Milano made in the 1910s. The difference is quite substancial:</p>


    
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TZLOrfJn4mg?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve used to do so: <a href="https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl">https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the possibility to colorize footage, but color accuracy may be incorrect. Here&rsquo;s the repo: <a href="https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify">https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify</a>. It is used by MyHeritage, but you have to pay&hellip;</p>
