      <description>While I was on a glacier yesterday, we were practicing some crevasse rescue operations. The glacier was covered in deep snow. The most common thing to do when a person falls into a crevasse is to firstly secure the person with a glacier sling attached to an axle placed vertically. Then you have to make two fixed points to recover the person with a hoist.&#xA;In the case of a glacier exposed with ice, you can simply use ice screws, but in the case of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s scenario, it is common to dig an axle with a sling coming out and build an anchor from it.</description>

While there&amp;rsquo;s truth to this, recent evidence suggests that even at low intensities, carbohydrates play a significant role in fueling your ride.</description>
