      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;m in love with this piece of gear. It uses a logarithmic spiral to convert downward force into a normal force on the sides. Physically, it holds independent of the pull force, as shown in the next photo. The condition only takes into account the friction coefficient. It can work in perfectly parallel cracks witch is amazing.&#xA;A logaritmic spyral is a curuve with this parametric equation in cartesian coordinates:</description>

      <title>Where to Hitch a Sling on an Axle in Crevasse Rescue - Overkill Analysis</title>

      <description>While I was on a glacier yesterday, we were practicing some crevasse rescue operations. The glacier was covered in deep snow. The most common thing to do when a person falls into a crevasse is to firstly secure the person with a glacier sling attached to an axle placed vertically. Then you have to make two fixed points to recover the person with a hoist.&#xA;In the case of a glacier exposed with ice, you can simply use ice screws, but in the case of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s scenario, it is common to dig an axle with a sling coming out and build an anchor from it.</description>

      <title>How to Install the Cinestyle Preset on Canon Cameras: A Step-by-Step Guide</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/cinestyle/</link>

      <description>Cinestyle is a popular camera preset that is widely used in the film and video production industry. It is a picture style that is designed to give Canon cameras a flatter and more neutral color profile. This allows for greater flexibility in post-production, giving filmmakers more control over the final look of their footage. Installing the Cinestyle preset on a Canon camera is a relatively simple process that can be completed in a few easy steps.</description>

      <title>Improve video quality using neural networks</title>

      <description>Video upscaling, the process of increasing the resolution of a video, has been a popular technique for enhancing the viewing experience of older content. However, traditional upscaling techniques often result in blurry or pixelated images that lack the sharpness and detail of true high-resolution video.&#xA;Fortunately, advances neural networks have led to the development of more sophisticated upscaling algorithms that can produce remarkably detailed and clear images. These algorithms use machine learning models to analyze and reconstruct low-resolution video frames, filling in missing information and enhancing fine details.</description>

      <description>If you want to analyze your power data there&amp;rsquo;s a free online tool called intervals.icu, it is community based, open suorce and allows you to do amazing stuff. I made a quick video about it, sorry if quality is not the best. Some people told me music is too loud, i agree!!! But i&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to upload it again&amp;hellip; :)</description>

      <description>Every cycling daddy I know in the week-end goes out for 150k rides without eating&amp;hellip;&#xA;Carb the fuck up You might think that during low-intensity rides (regular pace for a &amp;gt;100k ride), your body primarily burns fat for fuel. While there&amp;rsquo;s truth to this, recent evidence suggests that even at low intensities, carbohydrates play a significant role in fueling your ride. Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down with some math:&#xA;Consider a comfortable Zone 2 (Z2) ride, averaging 200 watts for 2 hours.</description>

      <description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in many areas of daily life, from speech recognition to self-driving cars. While this technology has the potential to improve the quality of human life in many ways, there are also concerns associated with its use. In particular, there is a growing concern about the negative implications of AI on society and humanity. In this article, we will explore some of the problems associated with AI and how they can be addressed.</description>
