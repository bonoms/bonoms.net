			<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in many areas of daily life, from speech recognition to self-driving cars. While this technology has the potential to improve the quality of human life in many ways, there are also concerns associated with its use. In particular, there is a growing concern about the negative implications of AI on society and humanity. In this article, we will explore some of the problems associated with AI and how they can be addressed.</p>
<p>One of the primary issues with AI is the lack of transparency. Many AI algorithms are opaque, and it is unclear how they make decisions. This means that it is not always clear how AI arrives at certain conclusions, which can lead to discriminatory or incorrect decisions. For example, if AI is used to select job candidates, and the algorithm has been trained on historical data that reflects sexism or racism, it may exclude some candidates based on irrelevant factors such as their gender or race. This can lead to a lack of diversity in the workforce and perpetuate existing inequalities.</p>
<p>Another problem related to AI is the risk of losing control. In the future, AI could become so advanced that it surpasses human intelligence and makes autonomous decisions. This raises concerns about safety and accountability, as it may be difficult to understand how AI made a certain decision and who is responsible if that decision has negative consequences. For example, if a self-driving car causes a fatal accident, who is responsible: the car manufacturer, the car owner, or the AI itself?</p>
<p>Another concern regarding AI is the loss of jobs. AI is already replacing many manual jobs, such as those related to manufacturing and logistics. However, it is expected to also replace many jobs that require cognitive skills, such as accounting and legal consulting. This could lead to an increase in unemployment and exacerbate economic inequalities.</p>
<p>Finally, AI could be used for malicious purposes. For example, AI could be used to create autonomous weapons that make lethal decisions without human intervention. This raises concerns about automated warfare and the loss of human lives.</p>
<p>How can we address these problems? One solution is to ensure transparency of AI systems. This means that AI algorithms should be designed to make selection criteria and decisions explicit. Additionally, it is important to design AI with the ability to learn and adapt to new situations, so that it does not perpetuate biases or inequalities. We also need to establish regulations and ethical guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and beneficial way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of human life, there are also significant concerns associated with its use. It is important to recognize and address these issues to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and beneficial way that benefits all of humanity.</p>
<p>Howerver, there&rsquo;s one key difference: <strong>AI can&rsquo;t tell you if something is right or wrong, it is only a statistical feedback.</strong></p>
<p>Nevertheless the new AI developed by the company Openai that is getting popular really concerns me, it is too easy to use and this lead to ethic issues if used improperly.</p>
